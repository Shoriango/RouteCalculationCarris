Planning of the project:

Find what route is the fastest given time taken by other buses to get to the same stop.

Example: Person wants to go from Prior Velho to campo grande.

Two routes. Directly to campo grande Going to Areeiro, then metro to Campo grande Other routes can be added

Checks for both routes, buses that may go through the same stops, lets say a space of 5 stops

Bus 1 goes through stop 3 - 6 of that bus.

if it takes longer than expected given estimated time of arrival, we can see there might be some traffic.

this should also be only given data 30 minutes prior (to be discussed)

Then we check route to Areeiro and metro

if the route areeiro metro is faster than the one directly to campo grande given traffic, indicate that one.

Still to be planned how it will be calculated.

Will have to use multiple real life examples.
